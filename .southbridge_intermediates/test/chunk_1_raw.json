    "text": "I'd love to, but I'm already tied up managing this project and my line manager Kate has agreed that I should focus on the timelines, reporting, and financial management. I'd like Akiko to lead on the questionnaire. You learned about this on your marketing and PR course, didn't you?"

    "speaker": "Speaker 2",

    "speaker": "Speaker 5",
    "start": "02:36",
    "text": "It's up to you, but I'm happy to support Matteo with his regular work just for a couple of weeks so he can create the designs. He's the only one with the expertise."
